# NYC Bike Sharing Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a group of shareholders an analysis of New York City ridesharing data so that they can provide a thorough proposal to investors for a ridesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Tableau was used to create several visualizations of a very large dataset of rideshare data that includes trip location, trip duration, and rider type and gender. A story was created in Tableau that includes each of the visualizations. The story can be viewed by clicking the link below.

## Summary
It is evident in the visualizations above that bike sharing is very much linked to work commutes, especially short commutes and for males. Assuming Des Moines has a bustling downtown area that includes sufficient employment opportunities and residential areas near such employment, the city could definitely benefit from a bike sharing program. Two additional analyses that should be completed involve Des Moines specifically. An analysis of the land use and zoning of Des Moines and an analysis of the demographics of the city of Des Moines would be beneficial. The program would benefit from knowing where employment opportunities are and where people are living. It would also help to see a gender breakdown of this data. This same analysis would allow shareholders and investors to understand not only the feasibility of such a program but also aid in its implementation.
